# Interactive Waves using Matplotlib
This is a 2D simulator for waves, you can create your own environment, set variables to increase intensity and other options. There are some aproximation in the propagation of the wave for simplicity of calculation and there is only amplitude at play here, not fase.

Everything here was done with Matplotlib and Numpy.
